## My process

In this project, I consolidated the knowledge of using the position property. I learned the new aspect-ratio property, thanks to which I obtained the respon- sibility of the picture. I centered the image using the flex property. I used the nth-of-type pseudo-class for styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

 I learned the new aspect-ratio property, thanks to which I obtained the respon- sibility of the picture.

### Continued development

By continuing to learn, I need to consolidate my knowledge of using the flexbox property.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/aspect-ratio/) - This helped me understand how to use aspect-ratio property.
